## 📞 Support & Next Steps

### If You Have Issues:

1. **Check QUICK_START.md** - Covers 90% of setup problems
2. **Check LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md** - Systematic verification
3. **Check function logs** - Supabase Dashboard → Edge Functions
4. **Check scraper logs** - Terminal output

### Common Issues & Solutions:
```
"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not configured"
→ Add to Supabase secrets

→ Start scraper: npm start

"Analysis not found"
→ Run migration: supabase db push

```

### Next Steps:

## 🎉 Final Thoughts

### What Makes This Special:

1. **Dead Simple UX** - Seller understands immediately
2. **High Accuracy** - Claude 3.5 Sonnet is excellent
3. **Natural Messages** - Prompt engineering for Whatnot culture
4. **Fast** - 15-30 seconds for full analysis
5. **Beautiful** - Modern UI with proper feedback
6. **Complete** - Nothing left to build for V1

### The Magic Moment:

When a seller pastes their stream URL and clicks "Analyze", they wait 20 seconds and then see:

```
"🎉 You had 12 buying intents you would have missed!
Here are the messages - just click APPROVE."
```

And each card shows a perfect, ready-to-send message. That's the magic. That's the product.
