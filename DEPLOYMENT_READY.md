git push origin main

# Also push the working branch  
git push origin cursor/resolve-dependency-conflicts-for-build-66df
```

### Automatic Deployments

**Vercel:** Will automatically redeploy when you push to `main`
- Build command: `vite build`
- Output directory: `dist`
- Should succeed now ✅

**Render:** Will automatically redeploy when you push to `main`
- Build command: `npm install`
- Start command: `node realtime-scraper.js`
- Should succeed now ✅

## 🔧 Post-Deployment Setup

### 1. Configure Render Environment Variables

Add these to your Render service:
```bash
SUPABASE_URL=https://piqmyciivlcfxmcopeqk.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key-here
LOVABLE_API_KEY=your-lovable-api-key-here
```

### 2. Deploy Supabase Edge Function

```bash
# Deploy the new monitoring function
supabase functions deploy monitor-realtime-stream

# Set secrets
supabase secrets set LOVABLE_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

### 3. Test the System

Once deployed:

```bash
# Test Render health
curl https://dealflow-ai-streams.onrender.com/health

# Should return:
# {"status":"ok","service":"DealFlow Real-Time Monitor","activeSessions":0}
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Real-Time Monitoring Flow

```
User clicks "Start Monitoring"
    ↓
Create stream_session in Supabase
    ↓
POST /api/start-monitoring → Render Service
    ↓
Puppeteer opens Whatnot stream
    ↓
Every 1.5s: Extract new messages
    ↓
For each message:
    ├─→ WebSocket → React App (instant display)
    └─→ Supabase Edge Function
            ↓
        AI Analysis (Gemini 2.5)
            ↓
        Store in chat_messages
            ↓
        If buyer (≥70% confidence)
            ↓
        Auto-save to sales_captured
            ↓
        Realtime update → React App
```

### Components

1. **Vite React App** (Vercel)
   - Landing page
   - Dashboard
   - Real-time monitoring UI
   - Post-stream analysis

2. **Node.js Scraper** (Render)
   - Puppeteer monitoring
   - WebSocket server
   - Message extraction
   - Supabase integration

3. **Supabase** (Backend)
   - PostgreSQL database
   - Edge functions (serverless)
   - Realtime subscriptions
   - Authentication & RLS

## 🧪 Quick Test

### Test Locally

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Start dev server
npm run dev

# 3. Open http://localhost:5173
```

### Test Realtime Scraper

```bash
# 1. Start the scraper
node realtime-scraper.js

# 2. Test it
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/start-monitoring \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url":"https://www.whatnot.com/live/test","sessionId":"test-123"}'

# 3. Check WebSocket
# Open browser console at http://localhost:5173
# Connect to: ws://localhost:3001
```

## 📊 Database Schema

All tables already exist from previous migrations:

- **stream_sessions** - Active/ended stream sessions
- **sales_captured** - Auto-captured buyer leads
- **chat_messages** - All chat messages (for replay)
- **profiles** - User accounts + subscription
- **user_settings** - User preferences

## 🎯 How to Use

### Start Monitoring a Live Stream

```typescript
import { RealtimeMonitor } from '@/components/RealtimeMonitor';

function DashboardPage() {
  return <RealtimeMonitor />;
}
```

**User Flow:**
1. Enter Whatnot stream URL
2. Click "Start Monitoring"
3. See live chat in real-time
4. Get instant buyer alerts
5. All buyers auto-saved to database
6. Click "Stop" when done

### Analyze Past Streams

```typescript
import { StreamAnalyzer } from '@/components/StreamAnalyzer';

function AnalysisPage() {
  return <StreamAnalyzer />;
}
```

**User Flow:**
1. Enter ended stream URL
2. Click "Analyze with AI"
3. Wait for scraping + AI analysis
4. View report with all buyers
5. Copy personalized messages

## 💰 Expected Costs

- Render: 750 free hours/month
- Vercel: Free (hobby plan)
- AI: ~$0.01 per 1000 messages

### Production (Paid)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails on Vercel
```bash
# Check package.json is using Vite
"build": "vite build"  # ✅ Correct
"build": "next build"  # ❌ Wrong

# Verify zod version
"zod": "^3.25.0"  # ✅ Correct
"zod": "3.23.8"   # ❌ Causes dependency conflict
```

### Render Deployment Fails
```bash
# Check environment variables are set
SUPABASE_URL=...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...

# Check Chrome is available
CHROME_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/opt/render/.cache/chromium/bin/chromium
```

### Messages Not Being Detected
```bash
# 1. Check Render logs
# 2. Enable screenshots for debugging
DEALFLOW_SAVE_SCREENSHOT=true

# 3. Verify WebSocket connection
# Browser console should show: "📡 WebSocket connected"
```
