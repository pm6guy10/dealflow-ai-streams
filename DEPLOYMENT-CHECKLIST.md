# 🚀 DealFlow AI - Deployment Checklist

## ✅ What's Complete

### Core AI Features (DONE)
- ✅ Claude API integration (`/lib/ai.js`)
- ✅ AI intent detection (analyzes messages for genuine buyer intent)
- ✅ AI message drafting (generates personalized DMs)
- ✅ `/api/analyze-stream` endpoint (scraping + AI analysis)
- ✅ Beautiful dashboard UI (`stream-report.html`)
- ✅ Approve/Edit/Skip buttons with copy-to-clipboard
- ✅ Frontend deployed to Vercel

### Live URLs
- **Frontend (Vercel):** https://dealflow-ai-streams-o7rv4bdax-brandons-projects-5552f226.vercel.app
- **Backend (Render):** https://dealflow-ai-streams.onrender.com

## 🔧 Next Steps to Go LIVE

### 1. Update Render with Latest Code
The backend on Render needs the new AI features. Two options:

**Option A: Manual Redeploy (Fastest)**
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Find your `dealflow-ai-streams` service
3. Click "Manual Deploy" → "Clear build cache & deploy"
4. Render will pull latest code from GitHub (including AI features)

**Option B: Auto-deploy**
- Render should auto-deploy when you push to `main`
- Check: https://dashboard.render.com/web/your-service-id/events

### 2. Add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY to Render
**CRITICAL:** The AI won't work without this!

1. Go to Render dashboard → Your service
2. Click "Environment" tab
3. Add new environment variable:
   - **Key:** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
   - **Value:** `sk-ant-YOUR_KEY_HERE` (get from https://console.anthropic.com/)
4. Click "Save Changes" → Service will redeploy

### 3. Test End-to-End
Once Render redeploys:

1. Open: https://dealflow-ai-streams-o7rv4bdax-brandons-projects-5552f226.vercel.app/stream-report.html
2. Paste a Whatnot stream URL (ended stream)
3. Click "🤖 Analyze with AI"
4. Wait 30-60 seconds
5. Should see:
   - Detected buyer intents
   - AI-drafted messages for each
   - Approve/Copy buttons working

### 4. Verify Logs
Check Render logs for:
```
✅ Extracted X messages
🤖 Running AI intent detection + message drafting...
✨ Found X buyers with drafted messages
```

If you see errors about `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`:
- Go back to step 2 and add the API key

## 💰 Referral Tracking (TODO)

**Status:** Skipped for now (you said "skip referral tracking" then "we should launch live tho that's a viral growth lever")

### If you want to add it before launch:
We can build a simple referral system:

1. **Database Schema:**
   - Add `referral_code` to users table
   - Add `referred_by` to track who referred them
   - Add `referral_earnings` to track 50% share

2. **Stripe Metadata:**
   - When user signs up via referral link, add `referred_by` to Stripe metadata
   - On successful payment, credit referrer's earnings

3. **Dashboard:**
   - Show user their unique referral code
   - Display earnings from referrals
   - Show list of people they've referred

**Estimated time:** 2-3 hours to build

**Do you want me to build this now?** Or launch without it and add later?

## 🎯 Success Metrics to Track

After launch, monitor:
- ✅ % of streams with buyers detected
- ✅ Avg # of intents per stream
- ✅ % of messages that get approved (vs skipped)
- ✅ Time to process 20 intents (should be <5 min)

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Missing ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
- Add it to Render environment variables
- Get key from: https://console.anthropic.com/

### "Failed to scrape stream"
- Check if stream URL is valid (must be ended stream)
- Check Puppeteer is working on Render
- View Render logs for details

### "No buyer intent detected"
- Stream might have very few messages
- Try a more active stream
- Check Claude API is responding (logs will show)

### Frontend can't connect to backend
- Check Render service is running
- Verify `DEALFLOW_API_BASE` in HTML matches Render URL
- Check CORS is enabled on backend
