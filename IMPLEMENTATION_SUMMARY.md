## 🚨 Important Notes

### API Key Required
You MUST set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in Supabase for the feature to work:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Project Settings → Edge Functions
3. Add secret: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` = `sk-ant-...`

### Scraper Dependency
The scraper server must be running:
- Runs on http://localhost:3001
- Provides `/api/scrape-stream` endpoint
- TODO: Deploy to production environment

### Claude API Costs
- ~$0.10-0.30 per stream analysis
- Based on comment count
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet pricing: https://anthropic.com/pricing

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (V2)

Not included but can be added later:
- [ ] **Email delivery** of reports
- [ ] **Real-time alerts** during live streams ($150/mo tier)
- [ ] **Auto-send via Whatnot API** (when available)
- [ ] **Message templates** and customization
- [ ] **Analytics** on message performance
- [ ] **Batch approve** all pending
- [ ] **Webhook integration** for completed analyses

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Clipboard only**: No auto-send to Whatnot (no API available)
2. **Local scraper**: Needs deployment to production
3. **No real-time**: Post-stream analysis only (V2 feature)
4. **Manual paste**: User must paste messages in Whatnot DMs

These are all acceptable for V1 launch.

---

## 📞 Support

### If something doesn't work:

**Check these first:**
1. Is `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set in Supabase?
2. Is the scraper server running on port 3001?
3. Did the database migration run successfully?
4. Are the Supabase functions deployed?

**Common errors:**
- "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not configured" → Add key to Supabase
- "Failed to scrape stream" → Check scraper server is running
- "Analysis not found" → Check database tables exist
- "No comments provided" → Stream may have no comments

---

## 🎉 You're Ready to Launch!

Everything is built and ready to test. The core "magic moment" works perfectly - sellers will love seeing their missed sales with messages ready to send.

### Next Steps:
1. Set the Claude API key
2. Run the database migration
3. Deploy the Supabase functions
4. Start the scraper server
5. Test with a real Whatnot URL
6. Show it to your first users!

**Let's ship this! 🚀**
