## 🎨 Design Philosophy

- ✅ Landing page simplified
- ✅ Mobile-first design
- ✅ CORS configured
- ✅ API endpoints working
- ✅ Claude AI integrated
- ✅ Deployed to Vercel
- ✅ Backend on Render
- ✅ End-to-end tested

### Post-Launch (TODO):

- [ ] Get seller feedback
- [ ] Track conversion metrics
- [ ] Add referral system (if needed)
- [ ] Build V2 features (real-time)

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Failed to analyze stream"
- Check Render logs: https://dashboard.render.com
- Verify ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set
- Check stream URL is valid (ended stream)
- Try a different stream

### "No buyer intent detected"
- Stream might have few messages
- Try a more active stream
- Check Claude API response in logs

### "CORS error"
- Verify Vercel URL is in CORS whitelist
- Check browser console for details
- Might need to redeploy Render

### Frontend not connecting to backend
- Verify API_BASE in HTML is correct
- Check Render service is running
- Test API directly: `curl https://dealflow-ai-streams.onrender.com/api/analyze-stream`

### Immediate:
1. **Test with real sellers** - Get 3-5 beta users
